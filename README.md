Still learning how to do these things, and need to get way better at HTML+CSS designing and Fitbit's Device APIs setup.

####ToDos For Later:
- Add in animation when clicking watch face
- Add in animation when top bpm bar moves
- Add in Goal % compared to white bar length
- Make refresh less taxing on application
- More modularity for various sections  
- ~~Make the text larger more proportionately~~
