# WH-R-Banner
A "simple and minimalist" Fitbit watchface with colors of Black, White, and Dark Red. In my personal taste, I've seen too many watch faces that come off as strong or too tacky, so I decided to make one for myself.

Still learning how to do these things, and need to get way better at HTML+CSS designing and Fitbit's Device APIs setup.

If you'd like to install the watchface for yourself, you can use the [gallery link here](https://gam.fitbit.com/gallery/clock/54750558-52f6-49c5-9d0d-8f1ffa509a6d)!
