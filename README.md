# WH-R-Banner
A "simple and minimalist" Fitbit watchface with colors of Black, White, and Dark Red.

Still learning how to do these things, and need to get way better at HTML+CSS designing and Fitbit's Device APIs setup.

If you'd like to install the watchface for yourself, you can use the [gallery link here](https://gam.fitbit.com/gallery/clock/54750558-52f6-49c5-9d0d-8f1ffa509a6d)!

###ToDos For Later:
- Add in animation when clicking watch face
- Add in animation when top bpm bar moves
- Add in Goal % compared to white bar length
- Make refresh less taxing on application
- More modularity for various sections  
- ~~Make the text larger more proportionately~~
